### Project made for the conclusion of the discipline of Web Programming at UNICSUL University of São Miguel Paulista constituted by Prof. Alcides Teixeira junior.

 This site was created to assist an independent investor who invests in Real Estate Investment Funds (FII) on B3 (Stock Exchange) using basically an API and JQuery. This investor has a website that generates a table with the
data of all the FII he invests, based on the table generated by me, he will be able to take in the future
decisions on whether or not to buy a particular fund.


To help the investor decide which FII is interesting, the FII lines with income
greater than or equal to 0.90 with a blue background (positive class) and for other incomes, with a red color
(negative class).
